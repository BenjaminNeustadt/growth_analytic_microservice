== Usage

To use the application follow these steps:

- Clone this repo:

[source, sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/BenjaminNeustadt/growth_analytic_microservice.git
----

- Install the dependencies:

[source, sh]
----
bundle install
----

- Setup the databases:

[source, sh]
----
bundle exec rake db:setup
----

- Run the tests:

[source, sh]
----
rspec -fd
----

- Start the server locally:

[source, sh]
----
rackup
----

The database is seeded with 200 example packets of data, that illustrate stored data extracted from payloads that correspond to "Signup events".
To add data to the database and expose it on the API endpoint you can use {url-postman}[Postman], or {url-ngrok}[Ngrok].

== Dependencies

- Ruby 3.0.0

- Sinatra

- Rackup

- Rake

- Activerecord

- Sqlite3

- Colorize

- Rspec

- Simplecov

== Testing

I used Rspec for both integration testing and unit testing.
To check for code coverage I used 'Simple Cov' gem, which reports approximately 99% code coverage.

== Approach

My approach was to first read the brief and consider the relations that would occur between the different payload packages for events and signups.
I understood that for the MVP only the signup events would be necessary, but I could not help consider the possible relations between signup events and pageviews.
Specifically I was interested in how pageview payloads could best be leveraged to extract as much information as possible from them.
Although I did not implement them, I considered such questions as:
In order to register a conversion event (from an unsubscribed user to a subscribed user),
and to know from where this user originally came from (thereby informing us which was the campaign driven the most adoption) which pageview event would be considered the original source pageview event: the one furthest back in time, or the most recent one?
I considered this when designing the API of the "events" which I labelled as "signup", "trial", "unsubscribe" to illustrate the basis for user state.
I also included conversion events within the signup event, if a user previously on trial "signed-up" (by using the fingerprint stored in cookies).
I did this because I felt it would be useful information for exterior microservices to quickly consult the "growth analytic" API without having to recalculate that information and slow down the process, since it would be consumed in real time.
I therefore thought that it would be useful to leverage the calculation of the database to omit some of that responsibility later on.

For the most part, my decisions were based on writing the cleanest and most efficient possible code.
I used Sinatra as a framework, as I felt that I could personally produce an MVP of a better quality using Sinatra, as I am more familiar with its DSL.
Although I was cognizant that those reviewing may prefer Rails, so where possible I attempted to incorporate a Rails "flavour".
I used an MVC structure, with RESTful routes.
The file structure is comparable to a Rails application; so the routes, for instance, can be found inside the "config" file in the root of the application.

I considered how I could make the application as "tight" or "compact" as possible, and felt that Sinatra would facilitate this, since I only required the dependencies I would actually need.
Since Rails and Sinatra both rely on Rake, the commands required to run the setting up of the database would be almost identical,
I used the challenge as an opportunity to better understand some of the ideas behind Rails, but was cognizant to keep the code as DRY as possible.
In some places however I was unsure if certain refactoring would cause a problem for speed.
For instance, both POST routes of "signup events" and "pageviews" currently use `process_webhook_payload` in "app/controllers/'endpoints.rb".

The longer build time was beneficial to not me, and in the long run these are some benefits that I considered:

1. Having built every aspect from the ground up I feel that I could personally more easily integrate new features or extensions.
2. I would eliminate some of the Rails magic by staying closer to Ruby language.
3. It would be easier for me to maintain.

In regards to what I mean by Rails flavour, besides the file structure, here is an example in syntax:

[source, rb]
----
# Rails routes

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root "articles#index"

  get "/articles", to: "articles#index"
end
----

[source, rb]
----
# Growth Analytic routes

module Routes

  def self.registered app
    app.post('/event') { process_webhook_payload }

    app.get('/') { event_endpoint }
  end

end
----

I considered other frameworks, particularly {url-hanami}[Hanami], which I understand to be faster in various capacities to both Sinatra and Rails.
I look forward to building this again using Rails, and then Hanami.
I also considered such questions as whether it would ne more benficial to use Web storage over cookies.

I was uncertain how the webhook would actually be integrated in the client-server communication.
Though I gave an example of what I understaod would be the process in my diagran below.
My initial though was that there would be a redirect to Blinklist from the webhook.

== Database

For the purposes of the MVP I used SQLite3, and used the ActiveRecord ORM, another database could easily be switched out for this one therefore.

== How I would approach such a task generally

1. Notes, initial thoughts, research
2. Diagramming (see below)
4. Tests
5. Build routes
6. Tests
7. Build things inside one file and gradually extract/refactor outwards
8. Setup an ORM and a storage file
9. Create seed data and use a service to post mock data

I would normally write tests first, and follow a test driven development process.
This instance was something of an anomaly as I played around with inserting mock data through the webhooks, and then found that I had not written tests.
So I then did regression testing. Having done so I felt more confident in refactoring.
I then fell back on test driven development when adding other routes and logic, specifically for the 'PageView' class that had not yet been written.
My main concern was really the attributions, so I spent a good deal of time considering those, I have left my initial notes on the API design at the end of this README.

== API endpoint design considerations
:NOTE:
The benefit of a microservice is that it can do ONE small and well defined operation.
Therefore, the API endpoint that exposes the data should not do any more than it absolutely needs to.
That will be the role of other services.
This service will only store and provide for later use the valuable data.
This is one step in the process. It's the entry point for the data, it is only the data factory.
